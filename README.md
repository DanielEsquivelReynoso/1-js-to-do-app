## Purpose

This project was a very quick exercise to show my ability to make a to-do application without using any frontend JavaScript frameworks. I specifically refrained from using jQuery and React while making this project as a way to test my understanding of pure JavaScript.

## Styling:

This project is styled similar to the Apple store website.
Three main sections are shown. The first is the navigation/title section, which inidcates that you are using Daniel's To-Do List. The second is the form section, where you can add in the new task to the list. The add button is styled blue. The third is where the list of tasks are located. Each task has text which indicates the task, paired with a complete and delete button. The complete button is styled blue while the delete button is styled red. The entire task is surrounded by a border.

The overall app is responsive and adapts to a change in the window size.

## Functionality

1. Add Task - Adds a task to the task list
2. Complete Task - Shows task is completed by a strikethrough on the text of the task
3. Delete Tasl - Removes task from the list
